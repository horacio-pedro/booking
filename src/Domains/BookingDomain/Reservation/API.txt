3) Create a Reservation as a User.


Note that if specialReqs, messageToHost and contactPhone are not valid, a null will be stored in DB.                                     
Also note that if no email is provided, the main email of that user will be the one stored in the Reservation.
Finally, as the internal implementation uses sets and since each userPricing is identified by its userPricingId, each
duplicate will be left out. Thus, you shouldn't provide userPricings with duplicate userPricingIds.


- Request:

curl -iXPOST localhost:8081/user/reservation -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{

4) Create a Reservation as an Admin.
