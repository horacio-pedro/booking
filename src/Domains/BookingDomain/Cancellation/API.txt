2) Create Cancellations as a User.

Note: 

- If the reservation is Pending, no cancellation is stored in DB. The only thing that                                                      
  happens here is that the number of rooms in the reservedPricing is decremented. In                                                        
  case that the reservedPricing comes to have a number of rooms equal to 0, it will be                                                      
  deleted. Also, in case that the reservation comes to have 0 reservedPricings, that                                                        
  reservation will be deleted.  
  
- If the reservation is Accepted, the expected behavior occurs: the cancelled rooms                                                         
  are subtracted from the reservedPricing (both from the number of rooms and the assigned                                                   
  rooms) and the cancellation is stored in DB.
